# Structured Pools

This repository houses the smart contract of structured pools.
Structured pools allow for tokens to be pooled together in such a way that they can be (1) valued relative to each other at something other than one-for-one, and (2) that relative prices can evolve over time.

This is implemented in CameLIGO, a DSL for smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain. The token standard relevant to this is the FA2 standard.
